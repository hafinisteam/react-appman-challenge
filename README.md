# AppMan Pokédex (My Pokémon cards list)

## List of done items

- [x] As a user, I want to see my Pokédex, so that I can build a list of Pokémon cards that I like.
- [x] As a user, I want to be able to search for a Pokémon card, so that I can add it into my Pokédex.
- [x] As a user, I want to see only unselected Pokémon cards on the search list, so that I can select a different Pokémon card.
- [x] As a user, I want to cancel adding a Pokémon to my Pokédex, so that I can close the Pokémon list modal.
- [x] As a user, I want to see the details of each Pokémon, so that I can see the abilities of a Pokémon.

## List of todo items (due to limited time), maybe I could do it if I were to accepted by APPMAN (just kidding lol)
- [x] Write unit test for components, helper.
- [x] Write intergration test and end to end test
